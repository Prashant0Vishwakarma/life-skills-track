Sexual harassment refers to a range of unwelcome behaviors of a sexual nature that occur in various settings, including workplaces, educational institutions, public spaces, and online platforms. These behaviors create an uncomfortable, hostile, or intimidating environment for the recipient. While not an exhaustive list, the following behaviors are commonly recognized as constituting sexual harassment:

1. **Unwanted sexual advances**: Making unwelcome or inappropriate sexual propositions, requests for sexual favors, or expressing sexual interest after being informed that it is unwanted.

2. **Sexual comments or jokes**: Making explicit or implicit sexual comments, innuendos, or jokes that are offensive or demeaning based on gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.

3. **Verbal or written harassment**: Engaging in derogatory, sexually explicit, or sexually suggestive conversations, letters, emails, texts, or social media messages.

4. **Sexual objectification**: Treating an individual as a mere object of sexual desire rather than a person with autonomy, dignity, and rights.

5. **Physical harassment**: Engaging in unwanted touching, groping, hugging, or any form of physical contact of a sexual nature without consent.

6. **Sexual intimidation or coercion**: Using threats, blackmail, or other forms of intimidation to force someone into unwanted sexual activities or to silence them about incidents of sexual harassment.

7. **Displaying or sharing explicit material**: Showing or distributing sexually explicit images, videos, or other materials without consent, including through electronic means or social media.

8. **Hostile work or educational environment**: Creating an environment that is sexually charged, hostile, or intimidating through persistent sexual comments, jokes, or other behavior that interferes with an individual's work or academic performance.

It is important to note that context, perception, and impact matter when determining if a behavior qualifies as sexual harassment. What may seem harmless or consensual to one person could be deeply distressing or offensive to another. It is essential to foster a culture of respect, consent, and zero tolerance for sexual harassment to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone.
